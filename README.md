The Fundrise logo is the most concise representation of the Fundrise brand. It is made up of two components - the work mark and the rising skyline glyph.

The word mark is the text “FUNDRISE” using customized letterforms based on the typeface Gotham HTF. The word mark should always be used in conjunction with the glyph, never on its own. When referred to in copy, the Fundrise brand should be expressed as “Fundrise” (not in all caps, just with the “F” capitalized).

The glyph combines the concepts of a column chart increasing in value over time and a city skyline, representing the building of wealth through real estate. In some instances, it is acceptable to use the glyph on its own:

* Avatar or profile images on third party sites, such as Linkedin or Twitter, where the glyph will be closely accompanied by the text “Fundrise”, making it redundant to include the word mark in the avatar.
* As part of an infographic or illustration which is already branded with the full Fundrise logo at the top, the glyph may be use to represent the brand as part of a process or system, where repeating the full logo would be redundant.
* Representations of the Fundrise brand in places where space is a constraint and there’s no way to include the word mark without losing fidelity (e.g. in a small graphic or favicon)
